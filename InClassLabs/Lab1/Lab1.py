# ## Part A:  The Local Standard of Rest
# Proper motion of Sgr A* from Reid & Brunthaler 2004
# $\mu = 6.379$ mas/yr 
# 
# Peculiar motion of the sun, $v_\odot$ = 12.24 km/s  (Schonrich 2010)
# 
# 
# $v_{tan} = 4.74 \frac{\mu}{\rm mas/yr} \frac{R_o}{\rm kpc} = V_{LSR} + v_\odot$
# 
# 
# ### a)
# 
# Create a function called VLSR to compute the local standard of res (V$_{LSR}$).
# 
# The function should take as input: the solar radius (R$_o$), the proper motion (mu)
# and the peculiar motion of the sun in the $v_\odot$ direction.
# 
# Compute V$_{LSR}$ using three different values R$_o$: 
# 1. Water Maser Distance for the Sun :  R$_o$ = 8.34 kpc   (Reid 2014 ApJ 783) 
# 2. GRAVITY Collaboration Distance for the Sun:  R$_o$ = 8.178 kpc   (Abuter+2019 A&A 625)
# 3. Value for Distance to Sun listed in Sparke & Gallagher : R$_o$ = 7.9 kpc

# ### b)
# 
# compute the orbital period of the sun using R$_o$ from the GRAVITY Collaboration (assume circular orbit)
# 
# Note that 1 km/s $\sim$ 1kpc/Gyr

# ### c)
# 
# Compute the number of rotations about the GC over the age of the universe (13.8 Gyr)

# ## Part B  Dark Matter Density Profiles

# ### b)
# 
# In the Isothermal Sphere model, what is the mass enclosed within the solar radius (R$_o$) in units of $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$? 
# 
# Recall that for the Isothermal sphere :
# $\rho(r) = \frac{V_{LSR}^2}{4\pi G r^2}$
# 
# Where $G$ = 4.4988e-6 kpc$^3$/Gyr$^2$/M$_\odot$
# 
# What about at 260 kpc (in units of 10$^{12}$ M$_\odot$) ? 

# ## c) 
# 
# The Leo I satellite is one of the fastest moving satellite galaxies we know. 
# 
# 
# It is moving with 3D velocity of magnitude: Vtot = 196 km/s at a distance of 260 kpc (Sohn 2013 ApJ 768)
# 
# If we assume that Leo I is moving at the escape speed:
# 
# $v_{esc}^2 = 2|\Phi| = 2 \int G \frac{\rho(r)}{r}dV $ 
# 
# and assuming the Milky Way is well modeled by a Hernquist Sphere with a scale radius of $a$= 30 kpc, what is the minimum mass of the Milky Way (in units of $10^{12}$ M$_\odot$) ?  
# 
# How does this compare to estimates of the mass assuming the Isothermal Sphere model at 260 kpc (from your answer above)
