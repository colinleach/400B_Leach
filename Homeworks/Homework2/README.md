# ASTR400B, Homework 2

There isn't much code in this directory. It contains the files asked for in the homework instructions, but these are just thin wrappers around the Galaxy class defined in ../galaxy/galaxy.py (with a symlink in this directory).

Most of the manual testing is in ../galaxy/Galaxy_testing_notebook.ipynb and ../galaxy/tests/ contains automated tests: run `pytest -v` from the galaxy directory.
