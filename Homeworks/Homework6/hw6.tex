Calculations are in ./OrbitCOM.ipynb, this is just a summary.

\section*{2) Close Encounters and Merger, MW-M31}

This is a bit hard to see in the graphs above (left subplot, blue line). For better mouse interactivity it was redrawn in Plotly:

How many close encounters do we expect? It depends a bit on definitions:
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item at 4.8 Gyr there is a relatively benign encounter
	\item just after 6.0 Gyr there is a closer and more disruptive encounter, after which the galaxies barely separate
	\item merger happens at about 6.2 Gyr (a \textit{very} close encounter?)
\end{itemize}

What do these look like in 3D? This definitely needs to be viewed in the browser, from many directions, but these are two attempts to make a static visualization:

{\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{M31_MW_3d_time}  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{M31_MW_3d_sep} \par}

In both cases, points are plotted at 1 Myr intervals, starting from 3.5 Gyr. In the left plot they are colored by elapsed time, in the right plot by separation. It's complicated...

\section*{3) Separation vs Velocity}

The overall trend is for higher relative velocities at smaller separations, somewhat like a Keplerian orbit of high ellipticity. However, it's not nearly as simple in this case. Points are plotted in time order, starting on the right at about 2.8 Gyr:

\section*{4) M33-M31 Merger}

The galaxies reach apocenter at [2.657, 5.414, 7.50, 8.914, 10.057, 11.057] Gyr. Separation falls monotonically at successive orbits (red curves) and unsurprisingly so does the orbital period (blue curve).\vspace{5mm}

{\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{decay1}\hspace{5mm} \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{decay2} \par}

The decay is non-linear, but by extrapolation from the last two points we can estimate 6.8 kpc/Gyr as an upper bound. From a 75 kpc separation, merger would take a further 11 Gyr (i.e. 22 Gyr from the start of the sim). A linear fit to all the apocenters beyond 6 Gyr gives a faster decay, with merger happening after about 6-7 Gyr.
