\section*{Research plan}
Given my unusual/ungraded status in the class, the aim of this project is to start by looking at the merger sequence (roughly, topic 5) then see where it leads me.

This is open-ended and I will look at as many questions as seem reasonable in the time available. No doubt this will be a balancing act between breadth and depth, but let's see how it goes.

I promise I \textbf{\textit{won't}} be constantly pestering the course staff for help!
