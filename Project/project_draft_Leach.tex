\section{Introduction}

The simulation of Milky Way--M31--M33 orbital evolution was described previously \citep{marel_m31_2012}. That paper included an extensive analysis of both N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. The present study uses data from the same N-body simulation to carry out further computational analysis.

\section{Data}

Data from one N-body simulation in \citep{marel_m31_2012} was supplied in text-file format by one of the original authors. This included position and velocity data for each particle at the current epoch ($t=0$) and 800 future timesteps. For ease of analysis, this was all transferred to the open source database PostgreSQL\footnote{\url{http://www.postgresql.org}} (approximately 1.35 billion records). The same database was used for computed summary data during the analysis.

Particle counts for each timepoint are shown in Table 1
