\section{Introduction}

The simulation of Milky Way--M31--M33 orbital evolution was described previously \citep{marel_m31_2012}. That paper included an extensive analysis of both N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. The present study uses data from the same N-body simulation to carry out further computational analysis.
