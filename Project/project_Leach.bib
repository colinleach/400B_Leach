	abstract = {We study the future orbital evolution and merging of the Milky Way (MW)-M31-M33 system, using a combination of collisionless N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the consequences of varying all relevant initial phase-space and mass parameters within their observational uncertainties. The observed M31 transverse velocity from Papers I and II implies that the MW and M31 will merge t = 5.86+1.61 –0.72 Gyr from now. The first pericenter occurs at t = 3.87+0.42 –0.32 Gyr, at a pericenter distance of r = 31.0+38.0 –19.8 kpc. In 41\% of Monte Carlo orbits, M31 makes a direct hit with the MW, defined here as a first-pericenter distance less than 25 kpc. For the M31-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 0.85+0.18 –0.13 Gyr and r = 80.8+42.2 –31.7 kpc. By the time M31 gets to its first pericenter with the MW, M33 is close to its second pericenter with M31. For the MW-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 3.70+0.74 –0.46 Gyr and r = 176.0+239.0 –136.9 kpc. The most likely outcome is for the MW and M31 to merge first, with M33 settling onto an orbit around them that may decay toward a merger later. However, there is a 9\% probability that M33 makes a direct hit with the MW at its first pericenter, before M31 gets to or collides with the MW. Also, there is a 7\% probability that M33 gets ejected from the Local Group, temporarily or permanently. The radial mass profile of the MW-M31 merger remnant is significantly more extended than the original profiles of either the MW or M31, and suggests that the merger remnant will resemble an elliptical galaxy. The Sun will most likely (∼85\% probability) end up at a larger radius from the center of the MW-M31 merger remnant than its current distance from the MW center, possibly further than 50 kpc (∼10\% probability). There is a ∼20\% probability that the Sun will at some time in the next 10 Gyr find itself moving through M33 (within 10 kpc), but while dynamically still bound to the MW-M31 merger remnant. The arrival and possible collision of M31 (and possibly M33) with the MW is the next major cosmic event affecting the environment of our Sun and solar system that can be predicted with some certainty.},

The parameter space of the encounters are constrained using the Identikit model-matching and visualization tool. Identikit utilizes hybrid N-body and test particle simulations to enable rapid exploration of the parameter space of galaxy mergers. The Identikit-derived matches of these systems are reproduced with
self-consistent collisionless simulations which show very similar results. The models generally reproduce the observed morphology and H I kinematics of the tidal tails in these systems with reasonable
properties inferred for the progenitor galaxies. The models presented here are the first to appear in the literature for NGC 5257/8 and NGC 2623, and The Mice and the Antennae are compared with previously published models. Based on the assumed mass model and our derived initial conditions, the models indicate that the four systems are currently being viewed 175-260 Myr after first passage and cover a wide range of merger stages. In some instances there are mismatches between the models and the data (e.g., in the length of a tail); these are likely due to our adoption of a single mass model for all galaxies. Despite the use of a single mass model, these results demonstrate the utility of Identikit in constraining the parameter space for galaxy mergers when applied to real data.},

	abstract = {The latest generation of cosmological simulations are on the verge of being able to resolve the structure of bulges for the first time. Hence, we review the current state of bulge formation in cosmological simulations, and discuss open questions that can be addressed in the near future by simulators, with a particular focus on merger-driven bulge growth. Galaxy mergers have long been assumed to produce classical bulges in disc galaxies. Under this bulge-formation model, though, the high rates of mergers in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) galaxy formation theory predict many more classical bulges than are observed. Furthermore, simulations of galaxy formation continue to generally produce too massive of bulges. Feedback offers a promising avenue for reducing merger-driven bulge growth by maintaining high gas fractions in galaxies and ejecting low-angular momentum gas driven to the centers of galaxies. After reviewing the results of relevant research that has been published to date, we use cosmological simulations to explore the ability of feedback to reduce or even prevent bulge growth during mergers. In dwarf galaxies, mergers actually reduce the central concentration of galaxies as the induced burst of star formation drives out low-angular momentum material. This result shows the potential for feedback to reduce central mass growth. However, we also demonstrate that it is very difficult for current stellar feedback models to reproduce the small bulges observed in more massive disc galaxies like the Milky Way. We argue that feedback models need to be improved, or an additional source of feedback such as AGN is necessary to generate the required outflows.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution 
of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining
theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a
function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation
models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a
particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori
cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what
kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the
observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and
galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that
this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with
observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of
mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause
quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering
mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the
observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as
well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and
clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed
excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z {\textasciitilde} 0.2-2.5 is a natural
prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions
with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate
that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to
the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of
{\textasciitilde}L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast
this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or
other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling
probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert
luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar
clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions
suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar
luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly
classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity
Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement
with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all
redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of
quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of
recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud
and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with
observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme
secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds
via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts
before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a
history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier
times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful
means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast
cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as
starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We determine the velocity vector of M31 with respect to the Milky Way and use this to constrain the mass of the Local Group, based on Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion measurements of three fields presented in Paper I. We construct N-body models for M31 to correct the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal to M31. This yields an unbiased estimate for the M31 center-of-mass motion. We also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group, following previous work but with an expanded satellite sample. All estimates are mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse velocity of (vW , vN ) = (– 125.2 ± 30.8, –73.8 ± 28.4) km s–1. We correct for the reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion within the Milky Way, which imply a larger azimuthal velocity than previously believed. This implies a radial velocity of M31 with respect to the Milky Way of V rad, M31 = –109.3 ± 4.4 km s–1, and a tangential velocity of V tan, M31 = 17.0 km s–1, with a 1σ confidence region of V tan, M31 ⩽ 34.3 km s–1. Hence, the velocity vector of M31 is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit toward the Milky Way. We revise prior estimates for the Local Group timing mass, including corrections for cosmic bias and scatter, and obtain M LG ≡ M MW, vir + M M31, vir = (4.93 ± 1.63) × 1012 M ☉. Summing known estimates for the individual masses of M31 and the Milky Way obtained from other dynamical methods yields smaller uncertainties. Bayesian combination of the different estimates demonstrates that the timing argument has too much (cosmic) scatter to help much in reducing uncertainties on the Local Group mass, but its inclusion does tend to increase other estimates by ∼10\%. We derive a final estimate for the Local Group mass from literature and new considerations of M LG = (3.17 ± 0.57) × 1012 M ☉. The velocity and mass results at 95\% confidence imply that M33 is bound to M31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations.},

We obtained new V-band imaging data with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC and the WFC3/UVIS instruments of three fields: a spheroid field near the minor axis, an outer disk field along the major axis, and a field on the Giant Southern Stream. The data provide five to seven year time baselines with respect to pre-existing deep first-epoch observations of the same fields. We measure the positions of thousands of M31 stars and hundreds of compact background galaxies in each field. High accuracy and robustness is achieved by building and fitting a unique template for each individual object. The average PM for each field is obtained from the average motion of the M31 stars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. For the three fields, the observed PMs (μ W , μ N ) are, in units of mas yr–1, (– 0.0458, –0.0376) ± (0.0165, 0.0154), (– 0.0533, –0.0104) ± (0.0246, 0.0244), and (– 0.0179, –0.0357) ± (0.0278, 0.0272), respectively. The ability to average over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a final displacement accuracy of a few thousandths of a pixel, corresponding to only 12 μas yr–1. This is comparable to what has been achieved for other Local Group galaxies using Very Long Baseline Array observations of water masers. Potential systematic errors are controlled by an analysis strategy that corrects for detector charge transfer inefficiency, spatially and time-dependent geometric distortion, and point-spread function variations. The robustness of the PM measurements and uncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments, taken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well as measurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results. Papers II and III of this series explore the implications of the new measurements for our understanding of the history, future, and mass of the Local Group.},
