	abstract = {We study the future orbital evolution and merging of the Milky Way (MW)-M31-M33 system, using a combination of collisionless N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the consequences of varying all relevant initial phase-space and mass parameters within their observational uncertainties. The observed M31 transverse velocity from Papers I and II implies that the MW and M31 will merge t = 5.86+1.61 –0.72 Gyr from now. The first pericenter occurs at t = 3.87+0.42 –0.32 Gyr, at a pericenter distance of r = 31.0+38.0 –19.8 kpc. In 41\% of Monte Carlo orbits, M31 makes a direct hit with the MW, defined here as a first-pericenter distance less than 25 kpc. For the M31-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 0.85+0.18 –0.13 Gyr and r = 80.8+42.2 –31.7 kpc. By the time M31 gets to its first pericenter with the MW, M33 is close to its second pericenter with M31. For the MW-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 3.70+0.74 –0.46 Gyr and r = 176.0+239.0 –136.9 kpc. The most likely outcome is for the MW and M31 to merge first, with M33 settling onto an orbit around them that may decay toward a merger later. However, there is a 9\% probability that M33 makes a direct hit with the MW at its first pericenter, before M31 gets to or collides with the MW. Also, there is a 7\% probability that M33 gets ejected from the Local Group, temporarily or permanently. The radial mass profile of the MW-M31 merger remnant is significantly more extended than the original profiles of either the MW or M31, and suggests that the merger remnant will resemble an elliptical galaxy. The Sun will most likely (∼85\% probability) end up at a larger radius from the center of the MW-M31 merger remnant than its current distance from the MW center, possibly further than 50 kpc (∼10\% probability). There is a ∼20\% probability that the Sun will at some time in the next 10 Gyr find itself moving through M33 (within 10 kpc), but while dynamically still bound to the MW-M31 merger remnant. The arrival and possible collision of M31 (and possibly M33) with the MW is the next major cosmic event affecting the environment of our Sun and solar system that can be predicted with some certainty.},

The parameter space of the encounters are constrained using the Identikit model-matching and visualization tool. Identikit utilizes hybrid N-body and test particle simulations to enable rapid exploration of the parameter space of galaxy mergers. The Identikit-derived matches of these systems are reproduced with
self-consistent collisionless simulations which show very similar results. The models generally reproduce the observed morphology and H I kinematics of the tidal tails in these systems with reasonable
properties inferred for the progenitor galaxies. The models presented here are the first to appear in the literature for NGC 5257/8 and NGC 2623, and The Mice and the Antennae are compared with previously published models. Based on the assumed mass model and our derived initial conditions, the models indicate that the four systems are currently being viewed 175-260 Myr after first passage and cover a wide range of merger stages. In some instances there are mismatches between the models and the data (e.g., in the length of a tail); these are likely due to our adoption of a single mass model for all galaxies. Despite the use of a single mass model, these results demonstrate the utility of Identikit in constraining the parameter space for galaxy mergers when applied to real data.},

	abstract = {The latest generation of cosmological simulations are on the verge of being able to resolve the structure of bulges for the first time. Hence, we review the current state of bulge formation in cosmological simulations, and discuss open questions that can be addressed in the near future by simulators, with a particular focus on merger-driven bulge growth. Galaxy mergers have long been assumed to produce classical bulges in disc galaxies. Under this bulge-formation model, though, the high rates of mergers in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) galaxy formation theory predict many more classical bulges than are observed. Furthermore, simulations of galaxy formation continue to generally produce too massive of bulges. Feedback offers a promising avenue for reducing merger-driven bulge growth by maintaining high gas fractions in galaxies and ejecting low-angular momentum gas driven to the centers of galaxies. After reviewing the results of relevant research that has been published to date, we use cosmological simulations to explore the ability of feedback to reduce or even prevent bulge growth during mergers. In dwarf galaxies, mergers actually reduce the central concentration of galaxies as the induced burst of star formation drives out low-angular momentum material. This result shows the potential for feedback to reduce central mass growth. However, we also demonstrate that it is very difficult for current stellar feedback models to reproduce the small bulges observed in more massive disc galaxies like the Milky Way. We argue that feedback models need to be improved, or an additional source of feedback such as AGN is necessary to generate the required outflows.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution 
of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining
theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a
function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation
models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a
particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori
cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what
kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the
observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and
galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that
this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with
observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of
mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause
quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering
mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the
observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z = 0-6, as
well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and
clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed
excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z {\textasciitilde} 0.2-2.5 is a natural
prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions
with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate
that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to
the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of
{\textasciitilde}L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast
this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or
other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling
probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert
luminosities (significant at z = 0), the constraints from quasar
clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions
suggest that they are a small contributor to the z gtrsim 1 quasar
luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly
classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity
Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement
with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all
redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of
quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of
recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud
and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with
observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme
secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds
via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts
before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a
history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier
times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful
means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast
cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as
starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {We determine the velocity vector of M31 with respect to the Milky Way and use this to constrain the mass of the Local Group, based on Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion measurements of three fields presented in Paper I. We construct N-body models for M31 to correct the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal to M31. This yields an unbiased estimate for the M31 center-of-mass motion. We also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group, following previous work but with an expanded satellite sample. All estimates are mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse velocity of (vW , vN ) = (– 125.2 ± 30.8, –73.8 ± 28.4) km s–1. We correct for the reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion within the Milky Way, which imply a larger azimuthal velocity than previously believed. This implies a radial velocity of M31 with respect to the Milky Way of V rad, M31 = –109.3 ± 4.4 km s–1, and a tangential velocity of V tan, M31 = 17.0 km s–1, with a 1σ confidence region of V tan, M31 ⩽ 34.3 km s–1. Hence, the velocity vector of M31 is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit toward the Milky Way. We revise prior estimates for the Local Group timing mass, including corrections for cosmic bias and scatter, and obtain M LG ≡ M MW, vir + M M31, vir = (4.93 ± 1.63) × 1012 M ☉. Summing known estimates for the individual masses of M31 and the Milky Way obtained from other dynamical methods yields smaller uncertainties. Bayesian combination of the different estimates demonstrates that the timing argument has too much (cosmic) scatter to help much in reducing uncertainties on the Local Group mass, but its inclusion does tend to increase other estimates by ∼10\%. We derive a final estimate for the Local Group mass from literature and new considerations of M LG = (3.17 ± 0.57) × 1012 M ☉. The velocity and mass results at 95\% confidence imply that M33 is bound to M31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations.},

We obtained new V-band imaging data with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC and the WFC3/UVIS instruments of three fields: a spheroid field near the minor axis, an outer disk field along the major axis, and a field on the Giant Southern Stream. The data provide five to seven year time baselines with respect to pre-existing deep first-epoch observations of the same fields. We measure the positions of thousands of M31 stars and hundreds of compact background galaxies in each field. High accuracy and robustness is achieved by building and fitting a unique template for each individual object. The average PM for each field is obtained from the average motion of the M31 stars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. For the three fields, the observed PMs (μ W , μ N ) are, in units of mas yr–1, (– 0.0458, –0.0376) ± (0.0165, 0.0154), (– 0.0533, –0.0104) ± (0.0246, 0.0244), and (– 0.0179, –0.0357) ± (0.0278, 0.0272), respectively. The ability to average over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a final displacement accuracy of a few thousandths of a pixel, corresponding to only 12 μas yr–1. This is comparable to what has been achieved for other Local Group galaxies using Very Long Baseline Array observations of water masers. Potential systematic errors are controlled by an analysis strategy that corrects for detector charge transfer inefficiency, spatially and time-dependent geometric distortion, and point-spread function variations. The robustness of the PM measurements and uncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments, taken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well as measurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results. Papers II and III of this series explore the implications of the new measurements for our understanding of the history, future, and mass of the Local Group.},

Their most massive stars are detected by Gaia, and we use Data Release 2 (DR2) to determine the galaxy proper motions (PMs). We select galaxy members based on, e.g., parallax, PM, color–magnitude diagram location, and local stellar density. The PM rotation of both galaxies is confidently detected, consistent with the known line-of-sight rotation curves: (counterclockwise) for M31, and (clockwise) for M33. We measure the center-of-mass PM of each galaxy relative to surrounding background quasars in DR2. This yields that equals for M31 and for M33. In addition to the listed random errors, each component has an additional residual systematic error of . These results are consistent at 0.8σ and 1.0σ with the (2 and 3 times higher accuracy) measurements already available from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging and Very Long Baseline Array water maser observations, respectively. This lends confidence that all these measurements are robust. The new results imply that the M31 orbit toward the Milky Way (MW) is somewhat less radial than previously inferred, , and strengthen arguments that M33 may be on its first infall into M31. The results highlight the future potential of Gaia for PM studies beyond the MW satellite system.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the second {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A summary of the contents of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 results.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (330–680 nm) and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 represents a major achievement for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for Msat/Mhost {\textasciitilde} 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of {\textasciitilde}3.3 for Msat/Mhost {\textasciitilde} 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of Msat/Mhost and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by {\textasciitilde}40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers.},

	abstract = {We use N-body/gasdynamical cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass proﬁle of its surrounding dark matter halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component of individual haloes in the proper cold dark matter ( CDM) cosmological context, and a second series where a baryonic component is added and followed hydrodynamically. The simulations with baryons include radiative cooling but neglect the formation of stars and their feedback. The efﬁcient, unimpeded cooling that results leads most baryons to collect at the halo centre in a centrifugally supported disc which, due to angular momentum losses, is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral galaxies. This admittedly unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their surrounding dark haloes. We ﬁnd, in agreement with earlier work, that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: post galaxy assembly, haloes are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant ﬂattening ( c/a ∼ 0.85). Haloes always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the traditional ‘adiabatic-contraction’ hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile CDM haloes with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the longstanding difﬁculty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy discs and the galaxy luminosity function. The halo contraction we report is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement which suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and ﬁnal distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the centre of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. Although simple formulae might work in particular cases where galaxies form nearly adiabatically, in general it might prove impossible to predict the halo response to galaxy formation without a detailed understanding of a galaxy’s detailed assembly history.},

These observations, done with the CFHT as part of the ATLAS3D, NGVS and MATLAS projects, reach a stunning 28.5 – 29 mag.arcsec−2 surface brightness limit in the g' band. They allow us to detect the relics of past collisions such as faint stellar tidal tails as well as the very extended stellar halos which keep the memory of the last episodes of galactic accretion.

	abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

	abstract = {Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for understanding disk galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied using the full distribution of stars from white dwarfs to supergiants. The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous (L-star) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated "green valley" region of the galaxy colour-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations.},

	abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega\_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n\_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N\_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be {\textbar}Omega\_K{\textbar} {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

	abstract = {We use numerical simulations to study the kinematic structure of remnants formed from mergers of equal-mass disk galaxies. In particular, we show that remnants of dissipational mergers, which include the radiative cooling of gas, star formation, feedback from supernovae, and the growth of supermassive black holes, are smaller, rounder, have, on average, a larger central velocity dispersion, and show significant rotation compared to remnants of dissipationless mergers. The increased rotation speed of dissipational remnants owes its origin to star formation that occurs in the central regions during the galaxy merger. We have further quantified the anisotropy, three-dimensional shape, minor-axis rotation, and isophotal shape of each merger remnant, finding that dissipational remnants are more isotropic, closer to oblate, have the majority of their rotation along their major axis, and are more disky than dissipationless remnants. Individual remnants display a wide variety of kinematic properties. A large fraction of the dissipational remnants are oblate isotropic rotators. Many dissipational remnants, and all of the dissipationless ones, are slowly rotating and anisotropic. The remnants of gas-rich major mergers can well reproduce the observed distribution of projected ellipticities, rotation parameter
	(V/σ)*, kinematic misalignments, Ψ, and isophotal shapes. The
	dissipationless remnants are a poor match to this data. We also
	investigate the properties of merger remnants as a function of initial disk gas fraction, orbital angular momentum, and the mass of the progenitor galaxies. Our results support the merger hypothesis for the origin of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies provided that the
	progenitor disks are sufficiently gas-rich, however our remnants are a poor match to the bright ellipticals that are slowly rotating and uniformly boxy.},

	include the concentration parameter, c, the spin parameter, λ,
	and the mean axis ratio, . For the concentration-mass relation we find c
	{\textasciitilde} M-0.11vir in agreement with the model proposed
	by Bullock et al., but inconsistent with the alternative model of Eke et
	al. The normalization of the concentration-mass relation, however, is 15
	per cent lower than suggested by Bullock et al. The results for λ
	and are in good agreement with previous studies, when extrapolated to
	the lower halo masses probed here, while c and λ are
	anticorrelated, in that high-spin haloes have, on average, lower
	concentrations. In an attempt to remove unrelaxed haloes from the
	sample, we compute for each halo the offset parameter, xoff,
	defined as the distance between the most bound particle and the centre
	of mass, in units of the virial radius. Removing haloes with large
	xoff increases the mean concentration by {\textasciitilde}10 per cent, lowers
	the mean spin parameter by {\textasciitilde}15 per cent, and removes the most prolate
	haloes. In addition, it largely removes the anticorrelation between c
	and λ, though not entirely. We also investigate the relation
	between halo properties and their large-scale environment density. For
	low-mass haloes we find that more concentrated haloes live in denser
	environments than their less concentrated counterparts of the same mass,
	consistent with recent correlation function analyses. Note, however,
	that the trend is weak compared to the scatter. For the halo spin
	parameters we find no environment dependence, while there is a weak
	indication that the most spherical haloes reside in slightly denser
	environments. Finally, using a simple model for disc galaxy formation we
	show that haloes that host low surface brightness galaxies are expected
	to be hosted by a biased subset of haloes. Not only do these haloes have
	spin parameters that are larger than average, they also have
	concentration parameters that are {\textasciitilde}15 per cent lower than the average at
	a given halo mass. We discuss the implications of all these findings for
	the claimed disagreement between halo concentrations inferred from low
	surface brightness rotation curves, and those expected for a ΛCDM
