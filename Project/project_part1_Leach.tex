\title{Future Dynamics of the Local Group. I. MW-M31 Interactions}

\author[0000-0003-3608-1546]{Colin Leach}

\begin{abstract}
	
Existing data from an N-body simulation of the local group is reanalyzed. Future trajectories of the Milky Way (MW), M31 and M33 are presented, with emphasis on the structural and kinematic effects of a MW-M31 close approach to 35 kpc just before 4 Gyr, then final approach and merger around 6 Gyr. Substantial tidal tails form after (not during) first pericenter, though most stars return to their original galaxy before apocenter. This also leads to the disk angular momentum vectors moving closer to alignment. For the dark matter (DM) halos, there is some increase in scale radius and a large increase in angular momentum during close approach. 

The properties of the merger remnant are examined in some detail, showing that stellar material is by no means fully relaxed at the end of the simulation (11.44 Gyr). Stellar material and, especially DM particles, spreads to larger radii than in the precursor galaxies. Stars are not randomized in the remnant: ex-M31 stars are concentrated near the center, ex-MW stars further out.  The central region is approximately prolate, with a highly elongated core and significant rotation about its long axis. At larger radii, baryonic matter appears kinematically distinct from the central region with a different rotation axis. Viewed over time, the stellar material continues to evolve until the end of the simulation at 11.4 Gyr, with a slow and irregular decline in rotation velocity. In contrast, the halo is largely stable by 7 Gyr and continues to rotate slowly, though with a slight increase in velocity.

\section{Introduction}

The currently-accepted model of galaxy formation involves baryonic matter (gas and dust) falling into gravitational potential wells created by local over-densities in the Dark Matter (DM). Further gravitational collapse and Jeans fragmentation can then lead to creation of galaxies and stars \citep{mo_galaxy_2010}.

However, decades of observational and theoretical studies tell us that, firstly, this by itself does not account for the wide range of galaxy morphologies seen at all epochs; secondly, there is no reason to suppose that galaxies continue in serene isolation after their formation. This led to the ``merger hypothesis'', now widely accepted, which postulates that many and perhaps most elliptical galaxies form from mergers of precursor galaxies: spirals, clusters, smaller ellipticals, perhaps in a long sequence.

Attempts to model interactions and mergers between galaxies with numerical simulations goes back at least to \citet{toomre_galactic_1972}.  This field continues to develop, with improvements in both hardware and algorithms allowing larger particle numbers in N-body simulations and more sophisticated treatment of gas hydrodynamics, magnetic fields and other factors \citep{bodenheimer_numerical_2007}.

As with all theoretical studies, it is vital to stay connected to the best experimental data as this constantly evolves, constantly comparing models against observations. Checking simulations against high-redshift galaxies is necessary but inevitably approximate. A perhaps more rigorous test is to model the galaxies for which we have the most precise and detailed observational measurements: those which are (by far) closest to us. 

The largest galaxies in our Local Group (LG) are the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33).  A simulation of MW--M31--M33 orbital evolution was described previously in \citet{marel_m31_2012}, hereafter vdM12. That paper included an extensive analysis of both N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. The present study uses data from the same N-body simulation to carry out further computational analysis.

The simulation was based on data in \citet{marel_m31_2012-1} suggesting that M31 is approaching the MW directly, with little proper motion detected by Hubble Space Telescope studies. Recent data from Gaia DR2 \citep{brown_gaia_2018} suggest that infall is slightly less radial than previously thought \citep{marel_first_2019}, leading to a slightly later first approach with a larger pericenter distance. However, detailed simulations based on that new data have not yet been carried out.

This paper will review the initial conditions and time evolution for multiple physical parameters of the simulation. Particular attention will be paid to the first MW-M31 close approach around 4 Gyr, the second approach and merger around 6 Gyr, and the structure and dynamics of the post-merger remnant.

Time probably precludes much analysis of the fate of M33, which will need to be the subject of a future paper.

\subsection{Data}

Data from one N-body simulation in vdM12 was supplied in text-file format by one of the original authors. This included position and velocity data for each particle at the current epoch ($t=0$) and 800 future time steps. For ease of analysis, this was all transferred to the open source database PostgreSQL\footnote{\url{http://www.postgresql.org}} (approximately 1.35 billion records). The same database was used to store computed summary data during the analysis.

\begin{deluxetable}{crrrr}[htb!]

	\enddata
\end{deluxetable} %\vspace{-5mm}

Particle counts for each time point are shown in Table \ref{tbl:counts} and total masses in Table \ref{tbl:aggmass}. We can see that total mass is the same for MW/M31 but our galaxy has more dark matter (lower baryon fraction) and M31 has more luminous stars (higher baryon fraction). M33 is about 10-fold lighter than either.

The coordinate system is approximately centered on the Milky Way at $t=0$. The center of mass (CoM) of all particles in the system is not fixed over time, moving at an average of $\vec{v} = \left< 35.9, -26.7, 27.5 \right>$ km/s with some minor fluctuations due to numerical approximations. In contrast, the total angular momentum of the system is very small at all time points.

\subsection{Software}

The work in this report was carried out in Python using standard packages. Full details are available online\footnote{Code \url{https://github.com/colinleach/400B_Leach}\\documentation \url{https://400b-leach.readthedocs.io}}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Trajectories}

The simulation does not explicitly include a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of each galaxy, but the galactic center was defined by calculating the center of mass (CoM) of the disk particles and iteratively constraining the radius of interest until convergence.

To plot motions of the three galactic CoMs it is convenient to transform to a coordinate system in which at $t=0$ they all lie in the $x,y$ plane with MW and M31 on the $x$-axis. The overall CoM is moving, as noted above, so at each time point the coordinates are translated to center it at the origin.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\plotone{traj_xy.pdf}
	\caption{Trajectories of each galactic center of mass in the X',Y' plane. Points are at 71 Myr intervals.
		\label{fig:traj_xy}}
\end{figure}

In vdM12 this is referred to as the X',Y',Z' coordinate system and their figure 2 shows multiple views of how the galaxies move through time. In this paper, Figures \ref{fig:traj_xy} and  \ref{fig:traj_z} show some alternative views in essentially the same coordinates (up to a sign; the $x$ and $z$ axes are flipped). Figure \ref{fig:traj_xy} reproduces the top left panel of vdM12. Figure \ref{fig:traj_z} shows that MW and M31 remain close to the starting plane while M33 has larger, irregular out-of-plane motions.

	\caption{Relative velocities of galactic CoMs.

\end{figure}

Relative motions of the CoMs are shown against time in Figures \ref{fig:rel_sep} and \ref{fig:rel_vel}, equivalent to figures 3 and 4 in vdM12.

There is a MW-M31 close approach with first pericenter at 3.96 Gyr with a minimum separation of 35.1 kpc, then a separation to 173 kpc at apocenter and finally a convergence to 7.8 kpc at second pericenter and merger between 5.9 - 6.5 Gyr. Relative velocities spike sharply during these approaches, as gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, before declining to essentially zero.

Figures \ref{fig:3view_first_apo_a} to \ref{fig:3view_first_apo_c} show a view of first apocenter as a disk density plot from three orthogonal directions. The full animation is available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colinleach/400B_Leach/blob/master/animations/collisions_disk.mp4}}

Meanwhile, in this simulation run M33 remains separate throughout, albeit on a decaying orbit. In vdM12 the authors investigate the effect of small changes in initial conditions and estimate a 9\% chance of an M33-MW collision at first pericenter, before the M31-MW merger.

\subsection{Mass profiles and rotation curves}

Figure \ref{fig:massprof0} shows the cumulative mass profile, by particle type and in total, for each galaxy. Naturally, the center of each galaxy is dominated by baryonic matter with the DM halo becoming dominant at larger radii.
\begin{figure}[bht!]
	\epsscale{1.2}
	\plotone{massprof_000}
	\caption{Mass profiles for each galaxy at the current epoch.
		\label{fig:massprof0}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rotcurve0} shows the rotation curves expected from these mass profiles. Without the DM halo the circular velocity would peak within a few kpc of the CoM then fall steadily at larger radii. With the more diffuse DM halo added, we see the relatively flat overall rotation curves which attracted the attention of 20th century astronomers including \citet{zwicky_rotverschiebung_1933} and \citet{rubin_rotation_1970}

	\caption{Rotation curves for each galaxy at the current epoch.
		\label{fig:rotcurve0}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stellar disk}

\subsubsection{Structure}

Figure \ref{fig:MW_density_early} shows the density of MW disk stars at the current epoch and after first pericenter, while Figure \ref{fig:M31_density_early} is the same for M31. The disks are thin and roughly circular early in the simulation, though by no means radially symmetric. These image are taken from a series of animations which are available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colinleach/400B_Leach/tree/master/animations}, files M*\_disk\_*.mp4. There are several files to accommodate changes in scale: later plots need wider limits.}. The spiral arms and dense central bar are visible in static images but much more obvious in the animations, where we can follow their rotation.

It is apparent that after close approach the disk develops long tidal tails and some out-of-plane deformation. This will be analyzed further in Section \ref{sec:close_approach}.

	\caption{Disk particles, cylindrical coordinates, from MW (left) and M31 (right) at three timepoints: Start (top), first pericenter (mid), near apocenter (bottom).
		\label{fig:6cyl}}
\end{figure}

Disk structure and evolution may be easier to visualize if we transform to cylindrical coordinates (with the angular momentum vector along the $z$-axis) and use $r-\theta$ plots. Figure \ref{fig:6cyl} shows this for the two large galaxies at several timepoints (as labelled).  Spiral arms show up in both early in the simulation. First pericenter has little effect, but 0.3 Gyr later we see highly prominent tidal tails. These images are taken from a full animation for each galaxy, available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colinleach/400B_Leach/tree/master/animations}, files cyl\_M*\_disk.mp4 }

\subsubsection{Inclinations}

Galactic disks have a well-defined angular momentum vector which is relatively easy to calculate in this type of simulation. Figure \ref{fig:inclinations_xy} shows the angle each makes to the X'-Y' plane over time.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\plotone{inclinations_xy.pdf}
	\caption{Angular momentum inclination angle to the X',Y' plane for each set of galactic disk particles.
		\label{fig:inclinations_xy}}
\end{figure}

The mutual angle between galactic disks and their angle to the orbital plane can both have a significant impact on how tidal disruption and merger dynamics play out \citep{toomre_galactic_1972, barnes_dynamics_1992, privon_dynamical_2013, ji_lifetime_2014}. These can be calculated from the vector dot products:

\[ \theta = \arccos (\hat{L}_1 \cdot \hat{L}_2 ) \]

Results for the MW-M31 and M33-M31 pairs are shown in Figure \ref{fig:inclinations_mutual}. For MW-M31, the angle is largely stable until near first pericenter, when tidal forces bring the two disks closer to alignment. This trend continues slowly until near second pericenter. Surprisingly, the angle appears to increase after merger. This suggests either some partitioning of particles of different origin within the remnant, or some additional factor that invalidates this simple analysis. A later section will discuss the complex radial dependency within the remnant, which Figure \ref{fig:inclinations_mutual} does not take into account.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\plotone{inclinations_mutual.pdf}
	\caption{Angular momentum angles between pairs of galaxies.
		\label{fig:inclinations_mutual}}
\end{figure}

The large variations in M33-M31 angles are indicative of the extensive tidal disruption of the much smaller M33 galaxy. Details are outside the scope of the present paper.

\subsubsection{Velocity dispersion}

This section only considers the radial velocity dispersion of disk particles in aggregate, viewed perpendicular to the angular momentum vector. The biggest contribution pre-merger is likely to be rotation. A later section of the post-merger remnant will consider radial dependency and try to separate rotation from random motion.

Dispersion is essentially the standard deviation of radial velocity about the mean:

\[ \sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(v_i - \bar{v})^2}{N} } \]

The changes in $\sigma_{\text{disk}}$ for each galaxy are shown in Figure \ref{fig:vel_disp}. The small periodic oscillation seen from the start, especially in M31, appears to be caused by deviations from radial symmetry in the disk: spiral arms and an increasingly prominent bar. Small MW spikes at initial pericenter (around 4 Gyr) and much larger ones at merger (around 6 Gyr) are clearly visible.

M33 is on an irregular, elliptical and decaying orbit about the MW-M31 merger remnant after about 6.5 Gyr. Velocity dispersion appears to peak at intervals. This perhaps corresponds to successive pericenters when M33 experiences maximal tidal disruption, but this will need further analysis.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{1.1}
	\plotone{vel_disp.pdf}
	\caption{Velocity dispersion of disk particles from each galaxy over time.
		\label{fig:vel_disp}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Stellar Bulge}

A bulge is present in the MW and M31 but not M33. This region of generally older stars extends further above and below the central plane than disk stars. Kinematics of the bulge are more typical of an elliptical galaxy than a spiral disk.

In a study of elliptical galaxies, de Vaucouleurs showed that surface brightness falls off exponentially from the center and approximately as the one-fourth power of radius \citep{de_vaucouleurs_recherches_1948}. Later work found that this was too restrictive for a wider population of galaxies, so Sérsic generalized the formula to have the inverse exponential $n$ as an additional free parameter \citep{sersic_influence_1963}:

\[ \log_{10} \left( \frac{I(r)}{I_e} \right) =  -3.3307 \left[ \left( \frac{r}{R_e} \right)^{1/n} - 1 \right] \]

Here $R_e$ is the radius with which half the light is emitted,  $I_e$ is the surface brightness at $R_e$ and $n$ is the Sérsic parameter.

This formula is intended for analyzing photographic images and is in terms of light intensity. We have no brightness data in the current simulation, but for systems with few young blue stars we can assume the stellar mass to light ratio $M_\star/L \sim 1$. This is probably a reasonable approximation for undisturbed bulges and for an elliptical merger remnant long after the collision. $R_e$ is then the radius enclosing half the mass.

\begin{figure}[bht!]
	\epsscale{1}
	\plotone{sersic_Re}
	\caption{Half-mass radius for bulge particles.
		\label{fig:sersic_Re}}
\end{figure}

We can see from Figure \ref{fig:sersic_Re} that for each galaxy the bulge half-mass radius is fairly stable up to the collision and merger of MW and M31. After a period of disturbance, they again become stable at a higher level. The M31 bulge is more diffuse than the MW bulge throughout, and the ex-bulge stars are clearly not randomized in the merger remnant: ex-M31 stars tend towards larger radii than ex-MW stars. A more detailed analysis of the remnant will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:rem_baryon_mass}.

\begin{figure}[bht!]
	\epsscale{1}
	\plotone{sersic_n}
	\caption{Sersic $n$ for bulge particles, with $1\sigma$ error bars.
		\label{fig:sersic_n}}
\end{figure}

The Sérsic parameter $n$ was estimated by a nonlinear least squares fit to the bulge mass profile. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:sersic_n} it is fairly constant around 5.5 for any period with meaningful data. The spikes around 6 Gyr should probably be ignored: many values during this collision period are missing because the least-squares fit failed, and the available data has substantially larger error bars than during stable epochs.

\begin{figure}[bht!]
	\epsscale{1.0}
	\plotone{bulge_mp}
	\caption{Bulge mass density profile for both galaxies at the beginning and end of the simulation.
		\label{fig:bulge_mp}}
\end{figure}

The larger half-mass radius of M31 is reflected in the mass density profile, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bulge_mp}. MW bulge stars have a higher central peak, M31 bulge stars are more numerous at larger radii. This is true both early in the simulation and in the merger remnant at late times. For bulge stars in both galaxies, the central peak is less pronounced post-merger.

The Sérsic fit for bulges looks reasonable outside the central density peak, as shown for the MW in Figure \ref{fig:MW_bulge_sersic}. The plot for M31 (not included here) is very  similar.

	\caption{MW bulge mass density profiles and Sérsic best fits. Time points are the beginning, the pre-merger pericenter, and the end of the simulation
		\label{fig:MW_bulge_sersic}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dark Matter halo}

\subsubsection{Halo mass profile}

Figure \ref{fig:rotcurve0} also added a theoretical curve in which the DM halo is fitted by a Hernquist profile \citep{hernquist_analytical_1990}. The cumulative mass out to radius $r$ is given by
\[ M(r) = M_h \frac{r^2}{(a+r)^2} \]
where $M_h$ is the total mass of halo particles (see Table 2) and $a$ is a scale radius which encloses a quarter of the halo mass. Non-linear least squares fitting, similar to that used for Sérsic profiles in a previous section, gave scale radii of 61.1 kpc for both MW and M31, 24.3 kpc for M33 at $t=0$.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	%	\epsscale{0.8}
	\plotone{hernquist_a.pdf}
	\caption{Hernquist scale radius $a$ for DM halo particles originating from each galaxy, with $1\sigma$ error bars.
		\label{fig:hernquist_a}}
\end{figure}

Time evolution of the scale radius $a$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hernquist_a}. The MW and M31 remain very similar through first pericenter, then start to diverge with MW particles tending to a larger radius than M31: the opposite of bulge particles. This becomes most pronounced during and after merger. The dissimilar distribution in the merger remnant will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:rem_halo_mass}.  

The scale radius for M33 grows inexorably as the original halo is scattered by tidal forces. Figure \ref{fig:hernquist_a} also shows the increasingly wide error bars for M33: halo particles for this galaxy are no longer well fitted by a Hernquist profile.

\subsubsection{Halo rotation}

The specific angular momentum $\vec{h}$ can be calculated from
\[ \vec{h} = \frac{\sum_i{\vec{r_i} \times m_i \vec{v}_i}}{\sum_i{m_i}} \]

The halo specific angular momentum for each large galaxy is shown in Figure \ref{fig:halo_h}. It appears that both are barely rotating at the current epoch, but spin up rapidly during first pericenter and again around the time of merger, as tidal forces convert orbit angular momentum into spin angular momentum. Differences in the remnant will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:rem_halo_spin}.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	%	\epsscale{0.8}
	\plotone{halo_h.pdf}
	\caption{Specific angular momentum for halo particles of each galaxy about its CoM (kpc$^2$/Myr).
		\label{fig:halo_h}}
\end{figure}

Data for M33 is omitted from Figure \ref{fig:halo_h} for clarity. The spin-up is much more dramatic for this minor galaxy, with peaks approaching 140 kpc$^2$/Myr, making it unsuitable to plot on the same axes.

\subsection{MW-M31 Close approach}
\label{sec:close_approach}

\subsubsection{Inclinations}

The MW and M31 disks have angular momentum vectors inclined at an angle of $52^\circ$ to each other shortly before pericenter. The angles to their mutual orbital angular momentum are $82^\circ$ (MW) and $88^\circ$ (M31): almost perpendicular, but values less than $90^\circ$ are formally classed as prograde approaches.

\subsubsection{Tidal tails and bridges}

The presence of long, symmetrical tails giving some galaxies a distinct `S'-shape has been described at least as far back as \citet{zwicky_novel_1955}. Some astronomers postulated that these were the result of tidal forces during close, glancing encounters, but this was often contested until a detailed computational study by \citet{toomre_galactic_1972}.

Reviewing a broad range of N-body simulations, \citet{barnes_dynamics_1992} noted that ``such features are clearly \textit{relics} of recent collisions rather than ongoing interactions'' (their emphasis). In our simulation, both MW and M31 disks remain near-circular during much of the close approach, but conspicuous tails develop as the centers then move further apart: see Figure \ref{fig:6cyl} and the animations referred to in Footnote 3. We also see a more sparsely-populated bridge forming between the galaxies.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\epsscale{0.7}
	\plotone{selected_a.pdf}
	\caption{Manual selection of bridge particles at 0.33 Gyr after the first MW-M31 pericenter: stellar surface density and the selected region. Orientation is with MW top, M31 bottom and M33 lower left. 
	\label{fig:bridge_a}}
\end{figure}

To determine the nature and origin of stars in this region, a manual selection was performed as in Figure \ref{fig:bridge_a}. Stars within the yellow rectangle are shown with velocity vectors in Figure \ref{fig:bridge_b} and origin in Figure \ref{fig:bridge_c}. Velocities are diverse: mean 195 km/s (comparable to $v_{\text{circ}}$ in the disk), range 19-586 km/s. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\epsscale{0.9}
	\plotone{selected_b.pdf}
	\caption{Velocity vectors (projected onto the $x-y$ plane) for stars selected in Figure \ref{fig:bridge_a}.

	\plotone{selected_c.pdf}
	\caption{Origin by galaxy and particle type for stars selected in Figure \ref{fig:bridge_a}.
		\label{fig:bridge_c}}
\end{figure}

It appears from Figure \ref{fig:bridge_c} that stars in the tail regions originate in the corresponding disk. The bridge region is more mixed and appears to have a high proportion of former bulge stars. To study this further the coordinate system was transformed to place the large galaxy CoMs on the $x$-axis at $\pm 64$ kpc, as in Figure \ref{fig:bridge2}. It is clear in this view that one MW tail is oriented approximately towards the center of M31.

The different orientations mean that symmetry about the midplane is imperfect, so the ``bridge'' region was taken as $-20 < x < 30$ kpc. A count of stars in this region is shown in Table \ref{tbl:pcounts}. This confirms that the largest populations are MW disk stars (mostly in a relatively dense tail) and M31 bulge stars (more widely dispersed).


\subsubsection{Mass transfer}

Stars are scattered from galaxies even in normal times, and this can be expected to increase significantly during near-misses and collisions. To get a first impression of how many stars and DM particles may end up closer to a different galaxy, we looked at the relative distances of each particle to each of the three galaxy CoMs. It should be emphasized that kinematics is not considered at this stage, so nothing can be said about which particles are gravitationally bound.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{0.9}
	\plotone{transfer_counts_mpl}
	\caption{Particles closer to a different CoM.
		\label{fig:trans_count}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trans_count} shows that some particles are far from their notional galaxy even at the start. This increases somewhat during first pericenter around 4 Gyr, then jumps permanently during the second pericenter and merger. The plot cuts off at 7 Gyr because it becomes meaningless to consider the MW/M31 CoMs as separate points post-merger.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{1.1}
	\plotone{transfer_ptype}
	\caption{Particles closer to a different CoM.
		\label{fig:trans_p}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trans_p} looks at a few timepoints by particle type, showing that the overwhelming majority of these particles are from the DM halo. This is unremarkable, given the prevalence of these particles at large radii and their correspondingly weak gravitational binding. Note that the pericenter distance, 0.3 Gyr before this snapshot, was only 35 kpc. The scale radius for both halos is now above 60 kpc, so this isn't just a tidal effect: there is extensive overlap between the halos.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{1.1}
	\plotone{transfer_lum}
	\caption{Luminous particles closer to a different CoM (DM halo hidden).
		\label{fig:trans_l}}
\end{figure}

To focus on the baryonic matter, Figure \ref{fig:trans_l} hides the DM halo and expands the $y$-axis to show only bulge and disk particles. There are significant numbers of M31 bulge particles at all timepoints, mostly reflecting the proximity of M33. The last three bars on each panel correspond to first pericenter, apocenter, and second pericenter. M31 disk particle numbers jump at first pericenter but these apparently remain bound to the original galaxy: virtually all return to M31 before apocenter.


\subsection{MW-M31 merger}

After second pericenter, the MW and M31 never fully separate and eventually merge. Their mass ratio is 1:1.6 for stellar matter and 1:1 when the DM halo is included. This is thus a `major merger', which is generally taken to mean closer than 1:4 luminosity ratio (or mass ratio as a proxy). A 1:1 mass ratio has been reported \citep{boylan-kolchin_dynamical_2008, ji_lifetime_2014} to lead to the shortest coalescence time.

	\caption{Approach and merger in a MW-centric coordinate frame. Points are spaced at 14.3 Myr intervals.).
		\label{fig:MW_M31_traj_time}}
\end{figure}

The 3D trajectories are complex, but Figures \ref{fig:MW_M31_traj_time} and \ref{fig:MW_M31_traj_sep} are snapshots which attempts to show this. The MW CoM is always at the origin and the points show the M31 CoM at regular 14.3 Myr intervals. First pericenter is at upper left (outer), apocenter at the bottom, second pericenter in the tight reversal at upper left. The path is smooth up to 6.1 Gyr then becomes more chaotic.

	\caption{Approach and merger. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:MW_M31_traj_time} except the color coding is by separation.
		\label{fig:MW_M31_traj_sep}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Inclinations}

The MW and M31 disks have angular momentum vectors inclined at an angle of $37^\circ$ to each other shortly before final approach and merger. The angles to their mutual orbital angular momentum are $74^\circ$ (MW) and $64^\circ$ (M31): more clearly prograde than at first pericenter.

\subsection{Merger stellar remnant}

\subsubsection{Remnant shape}

We can expect the remnant to settle over time into a triaxial ellipsoid \todo{ref?}. In observational astronomy it would be usual to determine the shape by fitting ellipses to surface brightness contours. That is also possible for the simulation, but for a highly-determined system for which we know the mass and position of every particle there are other options.

If we combine all the baryonic matter (disk and bulge) from both MW and M31, there are $1.12 \times 10^6$ particles to consider. Some of these have been ejected to large radius where they have an exaggerated effect on the moment of inertia, so only those within 40 kpc of the CoM were used in the calculation. These were about 88\% of the original stellar particles from the two precursor galaxies.

In the original coordinates, the moment of inertia tensor is symmetrical ($I_{ij} = I_{ji}$), $3 \times 3$:

\[ I = \begin{bmatrix}
			I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz}\\
			I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz}\\
			I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz} 
		\end{bmatrix} \]
		
\[  I_{\text{stellar}} \approx 10^3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
		3.26 & 0.181 & 0.152\\
		0.181 & 2.97 & 0.138\\
		0.153 & 0.138 & 2.80
	\end{bmatrix} \] %\vspace{2mm}
		
The orientation is arbitrary at this stage. To get principal axes we need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $I$. 

The eigenvalues give the moments of inertia about the principal axes, in arbitrary units scaled such that $A=1$ and $A \ge B \ge C$:
\[ A=1.0,\quad B= 0.85,\quad C=0.80 \]

The eigenvectors give an orthonormal coordinate system oriented along the principal axes:
\begin{align*}
	\hat{v}_a &= \left< -0.844, -0.438, -0.309 \right> \\
	\hat{v}_b &= \left< -0.524, +0.797,  +0.302 \right> \\
	\hat{v}_c &= \left< -0.114, -0.416 , +0.902 \right>
\end{align*}

Determining the shape of a three-dimensional distribution of particles is known to have many subtleties \citep{maccio_concentration_2007, jing_triaxial_2002}. As a simple first approximation, the moment of inertia of an ellipsoid with semi-major axes $a, b, c$ is $A = k(b^2 + c^2)$ where $k$ is a constant that depends on total mass. Other axes have the same form by symmetry. Solving for $a, b, c$ and normalizing gives:
\[ a = 1.0,\quad b = 0.94,\quad c = 0.77 \]
So by this method the remnant is triaxial (low-symmetry, with $a \ne b \ne c$). However, the minor axis $c$ is significantly smaller than the other two: the ellipsoid is approximately oblate ($a \approx b > c$).

%The numbers involved are shown in Table 3.

Coordinates were rotated to place the eigenvector corresponding to the major axis along the $z$-axis. By chance, this left the other eigenvectors within $7^\circ$ of the $x$- and $y$-axes. Orthogonal-view density plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_tensor}. In the mid and right panels the long axis of the density contours should be vertical, but this is clearly not the case. As \citet{jing_triaxial_2002} point out, the moment inertia tensor is sensitive to the outer boundary of the distribution. The 40 kpc spherical boundary used here is clearly too simplistic. It even appears from Figure \ref{fig:rem_tensor} that ellipticity varies with radius and is highest near the center; also that orientation varies with radius, with the outer contours having the long axis more vertical.

\end{figure}

The mass profile for each type of particle and overall is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_mp_type}. This is similar to Figure \ref{fig:massprof0}, which showed the precursor galaxies, except that the radius now extends out to 100 kpc to capture the more dispersed stellar distribution in the remnant.

	\caption{Mass profiles of the outer part of the remnant halo.
		\label{fig:rem_mp_halo}}
\end{figure}

Previous sections have shown that MW and M31 particles remain somewhat distinct after merger. Figure \ref{fig:rem_mp_origin} compares their mass profiles. For baryonic particles, ex-M31 masses are higher than ex-MW at most radii, reflecting the higher baryonic mass fraction in M31. The opposite effect might be expected for the DM halo, whose total mass was significantly higher in the MW (Table \ref{tbl:aggmass}), but this is not seen out to 100 kpc. Figure \ref{fig:rem_mp_halo} suggests we have to go almost 1 Mpc out before MW particles become the largest halo component. The will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:rem_halo_mass}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rem_lum_rho} shows a related analysis, looking at density within spherical shells rather than mass enclosed. It will be shown in Section \ref{sec:rem_st_kin} that the inner regions deviate significantly from spherical symmetry. Nevertheless, the trend is clearly for ex-MW star density to track ex-M31 density but at a slightly lower level

\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\caption{Surface brightness profiles of the remnant by origin, t=11.44 Gyr.
		\label{fig:rem_sersic_origin}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rem_sersic_origin} shows Sérsic fits to the surface brightness profile (assuming $M_\star/L \sim 1$). As previously shown in Figure \ref{fig:sersic_Re}, bulge stars in the remnant have an effective radius $R_e$ around double that in each precursor. We now see that disk stars are well fitted by a Sérsic profile in the remnant, with $R_e$ values around 3-fold higher than the corresponding bulge stars. Again it is clear that the merger remnant is not randomized and still retains a memory of its origins.

\subsubsection{Angular momentum}
\label{sec:rem_st_spin}

The specific angular momentum $\vec{h}$ was calculated for all the particles in the merger remnant and various subsets, as shown in Table \ref{tbl:remn_h}. Differences tend to be small for stellar particles regardless of origin, larger for the ex-M31 halo and much larger for the ex-MW halo.

\end{deluxetable} %\vspace{-8mm}

A previous section suggested that the remnant is elliptical but it is complex to define a precise shape from the mass distribution. An analysis of the angular momentum vector may provide an alternative approach.

Looking at subgroups of particle by origin, the mutual inclination angles are non-zero but generally quite small, as shown in Table \ref{tbl:remn_rot_angle}.

		\label{fig:rem_h_r}}
\end{figure}

That analysis used all particles originating from the MW and M31, regardless of distance from the CoM. To check the validity of this, we calculated how specific angular momentum varies with radius. Attempting to do this for thin spherical shells gave surprisingly noisy results with no clear interpretation. Instead, Figure \ref{fig:rem_h_r} shows values for all stars within various radii of the CoM. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\caption{Stellar angular momentum orientation of the MW-M31 remnant within various radii (spherical coordinates). $t = 11.44$ Gyr.
		\label{fig:rem_phi_theta}}
\end{figure}

To investigate this further, Figure \ref{fig:rem_phi_theta} shows the orientation of $\hat{L}(r)$ in spherical coordinates, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle in the $x,y$ plane and $\theta$ is the polar angle downwards from the positive $z$-axis, as in Figure \ref{fig:sph_coord}.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical\_coordinate\_system\#/media/File:3D\_Spherical.svg}} 

Again, we see a substantial variation by radius: the remnant is not rotating as a solid body. With the major caveat that we are looking at spherically-averaged values for a structure which probably has substantial (but at this point undefined) ellipticity, the remnant is clearly far from equilibrium and has a complex structure and kinematics.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\plotone{240px-3D_Spherical.png}
	\caption{Spherical coordinate convention.
		\label{fig:sph_coord}}
\end{figure}

This collision and a single merger is not sufficient to randomize stars within the remnant. This is consistent with the understanding that relaxation times are very long in collisionless systems on the scale of elliptical galaxies \citep[Section 1.2]{binney_galactic_2008}. During the conditions of a galactic collision and merger there is an additional mechanism, called violent relaxation, that be significantly faster \citep[Section 4.10.2]{lynden-bell_statistical_1967, binney_galactic_2008}. Despite this, \citet{barnes_dynamics_1992} note that structure from the progenitors can survive the merging process. Also, there is observational evidence from rotation curves of elliptical galaxies that the inner and outer regions are sometimes decoupled, e.g. \citep{napolitano_ngc_2002}.

\subsubsection{Effects of gas}

It was shown in \citep{cox_kinematic_2006} that simulated mergers lead to substantially different rotational kinematics if the galaxies are gas-poor (``dry'') and the collision is dissipationless versus gas-rich, dissipational collisions.

One way this has been explained uses Lagrangian mechanics, in which the state of each particle is defined by six parameters (typically 3 for position and 3 for either momentum or velocity). The state of an N-body system is then a 6N-dimensional phase space ($\Gamma$-space). Liouville's theorem considers the local density of $\Gamma$-space, and in particular it shows that the time derivative of $\Gamma$-space density is zero \citep[Section 7.2.2]{binney_galactic_2008}. 

If Liouville's theorem holds in a galactic context, this places some strict constraints on the merger remnant: it should preserve the phase-space density of the precursor galaxies. In simple terms, two wide, rapidly-rotating disks will be unable to produce a remnant with high central density and low velocity dispersion \citep{carlberg_phase_1986}.

This is thought to be at least approximately true for ``dry'' mergers. Gas-rich mergers relax the constraint by having efficient ways to dissipate energy as radiation, for example by shock heating of the colliding gas clouds, star formation and feedback from supernovae. This can lead to the stars in the system becoming dynamically cooler over time and more concentrated in phase space.

Much work has been done on simulating gas-rich mergers, as these offer more ways to produce the wide variety of galactic morphologies seen observationally. In contrast, the MW-M31 merger will probably have little gas in reality and there is none in the simulation, so this is a less-studied type.

\subsubsection{Remnant stellar kinematics}
\label{sec:rem_st_kin}

Initially, the stellar particles (from all origins) were used to calculate an angular momentum vector $\hat{L}$, then the coordinate system was rotated to place this along the $z$-axis. We might have expected the principal axes of the ellipsoid to correspond in some simple way to this projection, but this was found to be far from the case.

More intuitive results were obtained once the $\hat{L}$ calculation was limited to stars within a constrained radius of the CoM.  Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_10} uses a 10 kpc limit and shows that the major axis is approximately parallel to the rotation axis.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{1.2}
	\plotone{remnant_shape_10.pdf}
	\caption{Luminous star density of the MW-M31 remnant in three orthogonal projections. Left panel looks down the $\hat{L}$ axis, mid/right panels have this vertical. Contours enclose 50\% (orange) and 75\% (red) of the stars.
		\label{fig:rem_shape_10}}
\end{figure}

In this inner region the stellar remnant is near-prolate. Figure \ref{fig:isophote_xy} shows the contour points from the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_10}, overlaid with an ellipse (solid line) that is an approximate best fit. Ellipticity $\epsilon$ is low in this midplane, around 0.15.

	\caption{Contour fitting, plane perpendicular to $\hat{L}$ (left panel of Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_10}).
		\label{fig:isophote_xy}}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:isophote_xy} shows a similar fit for the mid panel of Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_10}. Ellipticity is much higher, around 0.5. The inner contour is also waisted and somewhat boxy; the outer contour appears more regular, but further statistical analysis is needed.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\caption{Contour fitting, plane parallel to $\hat{L}$ (mid panel of Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_10}).
		\label{fig:isophote_xz}}
\end{figure}

Within the inner few kpc, the stellar remnant thus has an axis ratio of $1:0.55:0.47$, with the long axis along $\hat{z}$. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\end{figure}

There may be a trend for the ellipticity to fall between the 50\% and 75\% contours, but the data so far is not convincing. If we extend the analysis to stars within 40 kpc of the CoM and add a 90\% contour as in Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_40}, the picture changes significantly. Out at radii of 20-30 kpc, the overall shape is more oblate, with the short axis closer to $\hat{x}$ as shown in Figure \ref{fig:isophotes_90}. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\caption{Contour fitting for the 90\% contour.

Nowhere in this data was a disk-like component detected. There have been suggestions that disks can survive mergers \citep{hopkins_how_2009, hopkins_how_2009-1} and that mergers can lead to lenticular (S0) galaxies \citep{querejeta_formation_2015}, but the current simulation does not appear to be an example of this.

Figure \ref{fig:rem_phase} shows phase diagrams in various orientations. There is a fairly clear velocity asymmetry along the $x$- and $y$-axes, perpendicular to $\hat{L}$, but not along the $z$-axis.

Mean radial velocities $\bar{v}$ and velocity dispersions $\sigma$ were calculated by binning along the $y$-axis (Figure \ref{fig:rem_disp_y_801}) and the $z$-axis (Figure \ref{fig:rem_disp_z_801}). For this and all the remaining stellar rotation plots, the angular momentum vector $\hat{L}$ was calculated for all stars within 60 kpc of the CoM and placed along the $z$-axis. The variation perpendicular to $\hat{L}$ shows clear rotation with $v_{\text{max}} \approx 68$ km/s, somewhat asymmetric. This is about a third of the circular velocity in the disks of the precursor galaxies, and high by the standards of ellipticals arising from dry 1:1 mergers \citep{naab_statistical_2003}. As expected, along $\hat{L}$ we see smaller and more random velocities with dispersion falling off more slowly from the center.

Central velocity dispersion $\sigma_c$ is about 176 km/s, so the ratio $v_{\text{max}} / \sigma_c$ is 0.39 at the end of the simulation.

This analysis was repeated for other timepoints starting soon after merger. Representative examples are shown in Figures \ref{fig:rem_disp_y_450} and \ref{fig:rem_disp_y_600}. An animation of the full set is available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colinleach/400B_Leach/tree/master/animations}, files remnant\_stellar\_disp\_*.mp4 }.

Clearly there are significant changes continuing after the initial merger. The timecourse of radial $v_{\text{max}}$ and central dispersion $\sigma_c$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_st_vdisp_tc}. Velocity dispersion stabilizes fairly quickly, but radial $v_{\text{max}}$ continues to decline slowly and irregularly. The end of the simulation happens to be a minimum but there is little assurance that it will stay at this value.

\end{figure}

The ratio $v_{\text{max}} / \sigma_c$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_st_vdisp_ratio}. This is a common measure of rotation speed in elliptical galaxies. As discussed below, there are unusual features about this remnant compared with most results in the literature, but a line at $v_{\text{max}} / \sigma_c = 0.6$ has been added as a rough division between fast and slow rotators. For much of its post-merger history, rotation is fast by any standards. Even at minimum the rotation is faster than expected for an elliptical with no sign of rotational flattening or a disk-like component.

\end{figure}


For oblate isotropic rotators, there is a widely-cited relationship between $v_{\text{max}} / \sigma_c$ and ellipticity $\epsilon$ \citep{binney_rotation_1978}: $(V/\sigma) = \sqrt{\epsilon / (1 - \epsilon)}$. However, this generally applies to elliptical galaxies which have been rotationally flattened, which is not seen in the MW-M31 simulation.

There has been less study of prolate ellipticals rotating about their long axis, but \citet{tsatsi_califa_2017} show observational evidence for such galaxies being reasonably common, and data from N-body simulations showing how they could arise from mergers of mutually-inclined spiral precursors. They also mention a ``very elongated, almost bar-like component'' in the remnant, which is a good description of the central regions of Figure \ref{fig:rem_shape_10}.

Similar results have been obtained from other simulations, e.g. \citep{wang_orbit_2019}. These authors also present data on stellar orbits in such prolate ellipsoids. This type of analysis has not been carried out for MW-M31 in the present study but could be an interesting future extension.

\subsection{Merger DM halo remnant}

\subsubsection{Density profile}
\label{sec:rem_halo_mass}

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{0.9}

	\caption{Spherically-averaged density profiles of the remnant halo by origin. Note the expanded $x$-axis relative to Figure \ref{fig:rem_lum_rho}.
		\label{fig:rem_DM_rho}}
\end{figure}

The mass profile of DM particles in the remnant halo is well fit by a Hernquist profile, but there are some differences depending on origin as shown in Table \ref{tbl:remn_hq}

\begin{deluxetable}{cc}[htb!]
	\tablecaption{Best-fit Hernquist $a$ for remnant halo
		\label{tbl:remn_hq}}

	ex-MW &   $95.2 \pm 1.4$  \\
	ex-M31 &   $82.3 \pm 0.9$
	\enddata
\end{deluxetable}

For comparison, the $a$ values for precursor galaxies at $t=0$ were substantially smaller:
\begin{align*}
\text{MW} &= 61.6 \pm 0.5\ kpc\\
\text{M31} &= 61.4 \pm 0.2\ kpc
\end{align*}
The overall time-dependence of Hernquist radii was shown in Figure \ref{fig:hernquist_a}.


\subsubsection{Angular momentum}
\label{sec:rem_halo_spin}

For the aggregate of all DM particles in the remnant at this time, the angular momentum vector has orientation $\hat{h} = \left< 0.64 ,  0.03, -0.76 \right>$, almost identical to the total for all particles (baryonic + DM) in the remnant. The magnitude $|h| = 13.1$ kpc$^2$/Myr is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the values for the individual galaxies about their respective CoM at the current epoch. 

We showed in Figure \ref{fig:halo_h} that halo angular momentum mostly arises from tidal forces during close approach and merger, and in Figure \ref{fig:hernquist_a} that MW halo particles subsequently have a significantly larger scale radius that M31 halo particles. As specific angular momentum is a product of radius and tangential velocity, it seems reasonable that we see a higher value for ex-MW Dark Matter when it tends to be at larger radius. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{0.9}
	\plotone{rem_dm_h_r.pdf}
	\caption{Halo specific angular momentum of the MW-M31 remnant within various radii ($h$ has arbitrary units).
		\label{fig:rem_dm_h_r}}
\end{figure}

The radial dependency of angular momentum for stellar matter was previously shown to be complex (Figures \ref{fig:rem_h_r} and \ref{fig:rem_phi_theta}). The analysis was repeated for the DM halo. Figures \ref{fig:rem_dm_h_r} and \ref{fig:rem_dm_phi_theta} show that the irregularities are confined within about 60 kpc, where there is dense stellar matter. Outside this the profile is smooth to at least 1 Mpc.

	\caption{Halo angular momentum orientation of the MW-M31 remnant within various radii (spherical coordinates).
		\label{fig:rem_dm_phi_theta}}
\end{figure}

The coordinate system in Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_phi_theta} is the same is that used for stellar particles in Figure \ref{fig:rem_phi_theta}. The range of values is strikingly different: in the remnant, the DM halo is \textit{not} co-rotating with the stars.
	
\subsubsection{Halo shape}	

The analysis was carried out essentially as for the stellar remnant in a previous section. DM particles within 150 kpc of the CoM were used in calculating $\hat{L}$ and this was oriented along the $z$-axis. Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_shape_150} shows the density plots and contours.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

		\label{fig:rem_dm_shape_150}}
\end{figure}

Fitting ellipses to the contours was carried out as before (raw data not shown). The results are summarized in Table \ref{tbl:dm_fits}, showing that the halo is somewhat oblate with $z$ as the short axis, especially in the inner regions captured by the 50\% contour. This may be an example of rotational flattening, which was clearly \textit{not} seen for the stellar remnant.

	\enddata
\end{deluxetable} \vspace{-10mm}



\subsubsection{Virial radius}

The DM halo has no sharp outer edge, it just gradually fades into the inter-galactic medium (IGM). One popular convention is to use the $r_{200}$ or ``virial radius'' as a limit: the radius within which the average density is $200\times$ the cosmological critical density $\rho_c$.

For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we can calculate the critical density from
\[ \rho_c(t) = \frac{3 H^2(t)}{8 \pi G} \] 
Currently \citep{planck_collaboration_planck_2016} we have\footnote{Wendy Freedman might disagree (very eloquently), but let's go with these values for now.} \\
\-\hspace{10mm} $H(0) \equiv H_0 = 67.74$ km/s/Mpc \\
\-\hspace{10mm} $\rho_{c,0} = 127.35\ M_\sun/\text{kpc}^3$

The simulation ends more than 11 Gyr in the future, so we need a different value for $H(t)$. By then the universe will be well into a Dark Energy-dominated epoch with near-exponential expansion. Then $\dot{H}(t) \approx 0$ and $H(t)$ asymptotically approaches its final value of $H_{\infty} \approx 57$ km/s/Mpc.

This gives us a lower bound for $\rho_{c,\infty} \approx 90\ M_\sun/\text{kpc}^3$. Then $r_{200}$ is the radius within which the averaged remnant halo density falls below $1.8 \times 10^4\ M_\sun/\text{kpc}^3$. At the final timepoint, this is $r_{200} \approx 266\ \text{kpc}$.

The total virial mass, enclosed within the virial radius, is $2.4 \times 10^{12}\ M_\Sun$, of which 91\% is Dark Matter. This is only about 53\% of the precursor mass of the two galaxies. We can see from Figure \ref{fig:rem_mp_halo} that halo mass enclosed continues to rise to at least 2 Mpc radius, suggesting that the virial radius is quite a conservative limit.

For comparison, if we used the current value $\rho_{c,0}$ throughout, the virial radius at the final timepoint would be about 266 kpc and the virial mass falls to about $2.3 \times 10^{12}\ M_\Sun$. 

The precursor galaxies have, as expected, somewhat lower virial radii: 227 kpc for MW and 222 kpc for M31 at the current epoch (based on $\rho_{c,0}$), broadly in line with literature values, e.g. \citep{dehnen_velocity_2006}. Both have virial mass around $1.3 \times 10^{12}\ M_\Sun$, so the remnant ends up at about 88\% of the combined virial mass of the precursors (at constant $\rho_c$).


\subsubsection{Remnant halo kinematics}

As for stellar matter in a previous section, mean radial velocities $\bar{v}$ and velocity dispersions $\sigma$ were calculated by binning along the $y$-axis (Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_disp_y_801}) and the $z$-axis (Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_disp_z_801}). For this and all the remaining stellar rotation plots, the angular momentum vector $\hat{L}$ was calculated for all stars within 150 kpc of the CoM and placed along the $z$-axis. The variation perpendicular to $\hat{L}$ shows clear rotation with $v_{\text{max}} \approx 33$ km/s, about half that of the stellar remnant and somewhat asymmetric. Along $\hat{L}$ we see the expected smaller and more random velocities.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\epsscale{0.9}
	\plotone{remnant_dm_disp_y_801}
	\caption{Velocity (red circles) and dispersion (blue +) by radius, $y$-axis: perpendicular to the angular momentum vector.

%	\caption{Velocity and dispersion by radius, $z$-axis: along the angular momentum vector.
%		\label{fig:rem_dm_disp_z_801}}
%\end{figure}

Central velocity dispersion $\sigma_c$ is about 178 km/s, so the ratio $v_{\text{max}} / \sigma_c$ is 0.18. This is substantially lower than at any timepoint for the stellar remnant: the DM halo is rotating slowly.

This analysis was repeated for other timepoints starting soon after merger. A representative example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_disp_y_450}. An animation of the full set is available online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colinleach/400B_Leach/tree/master/animations}, files remnant\_dm\_disp\_*.mp4 }.

\end{figure}

The halo appears much more stable than the stars after the initial merger. As \citet{barnes_dynamics_1992} suggested, it is intermingling of the DM halos that initially drives the merger and ``[l]uminous material dominates the central regions of merger remnants precisely because the dense luminous parts of infalling galaxies remain largely undisturbed until they finally encounter each other and merge within a now-common envelope of halo material''.

The timecourse of radial $v_{\text{max}}$ and central dispersion $\sigma_c$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_vdisp_tc} and the ratio $v_{\text{max}} / \sigma_c$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rem_dm_vdisp_ratio}. There is a gradual rise in $v_{\text{max}}$ over the 8-11 Gyr period, during which the stellar $v_{\text{max}}$ is trending downwards (Figure \ref{fig:rem_st_vdisp_ratio}), perhaps suggesting some angular momentum transfer from the rapidly-rotating stars to the slowly-rotating halo.

The literature consensus is that halo shapes are supported by anisotropic velocity dispersions, not spin \citep{frenk_dark_2012}. They can acquire angular momentum through tidal torques, as we already saw for each galaxy in Figure \ref{fig:halo_h}. This is often characterized by a dimensionless spin parameter:
\[ \lambda = \frac{J |E|^{1/2}}{G M^{5/2}} \]
where $J$ is the magnitude of the angular momentum vector, $E$ is the total energy and $M$ is the halo mass. Often, these are taken as the values inside the virial radius, ignoring DM particles lost to the IGM.

Total energy $E$ is the sum of kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $W$. We have the mass and velocity of every particle so 
\[ K = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^2 \]
Potential energy is more challenging to calculate. In general \citep[section 2.1]{binney_galactic_2008}:
\[ W = \frac{1}{2} \int d^3\, \mathbf{x}\, \rho(\mathbf{x})\, \Phi(\mathbf{x}) \]
We would need this to calculate the highly-disrupted situation shortly after collision and merger \citep[section 8.2]{binney_galactic_2008}. For simplicity, we concentrate here on the final timepoint about 5 Gyr after merger, and assume that the remnant halo is by then close to virial equilibrium. Then $E \approx -K$ and the calculation is very much easier.

	\enddata
\end{deluxetable} %\vspace{-5mm}

The calculation was run for the remnant halo at the end of the simulation and the MW and M31 halos at the start and after first pericenter. Results are in Table \ref{tbl:lambda}. Values for $\lambda$ in the current epoch are higher than literature values. For comparison, \citet{klypin_cdm-based_2002} find $\lambda \approx 0.03-0.05$ for both MW and M31 and $0.02-0.10$ for a wide range of galaxy halo models. Their calculations are considerably more complex than the one used here \citep{vitvitska_origin_2002} and no values for $J$ and $E$ are given for direct comparison.

After close approach, we already saw in Figure \ref{fig:halo_h} that there is a large increase in angular momentum, which is reflected in the $J$ column of  Table \ref{tbl:lambda}. We can reasonably doubt whether kinetic energy $K$ is a good estimate of total energy $E$ so soon after an interaction, but in any case there are only relatively small differences in energy and only the square root of these values is used in calculating $\lambda$. Whatever the absolute values, it seems likely that the halo spin parameter increases greatly during the simulation, driven by angular momentum changes, and remains high in the final remnant relative to the precursor galaxies in the current epoch.

Other than potential energy, relevant values for the remnant halo vary little over time post-merger. Figure \ref{fig:rem_data} shows that angular momentum, kinetic energy and virial mass remain within $\pm 20\%$ of their final value.
